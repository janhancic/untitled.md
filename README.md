# untitled.md Editor

A markdown editor.

## Why?
I'm trying to learn the awesome [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and some other exciting things, such as Flux, 
 webpack, ...

So after failing to come up with a good idea for a mini-project, I decided to build a online markdown editor (how 
 original). So this is basically just my playground where I'm trying to figure out how best to do things and how all 
 the bits and pieces fit together.

## Development
1. Clone the repository.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
1. Load `http://localhost:8080/bundle`
